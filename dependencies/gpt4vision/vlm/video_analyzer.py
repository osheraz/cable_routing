                Preconditions: Arg1 is in a reachable distance. No object is held (i.e., BEING_GRABBED)
                Postconditions: Arg1 is held (i.e., BEING_GRABBED).

                MoveHand(arg1): Move a robot hand closer to arg1 to allow any actions to arg1. Arg 1 is a description of the hand's destination. For example, "near the table" or "above the box".

                Release(arg1): Release arg1.
                Preconditions: Arg1 is being held (i.e., BEING_GRABBED).
                Postconditions: Arg1 is released (i.e., not BEING_GRABBED).

                Preconditions: Arg1 is being held (i.e., BEING_GRABBED).
                Postconditions: Arg1 is being held (i.e., BEING_GRABBED).

                Put(arg1, arg2): Place arg1 on arg2.
                Preconditions: Arg1 is being held (i.e., BEING_GRABBED).
                Postconditions: Arg1 is being held (i.e., BEING_GRABBED).

                Response should be a sentence in a form of human-to-human communication (i.e., do not directly use the functions). Return only one sentence without including your explanation in the response (e.g., Do not include a sentence like "here are the step-by-step instructions").
