Information about environments is given as python dictionary. Example:
"""
"environment": {
    "objects": [
        "<cup>",
        "<lab_table>",
        "<office_table>"
    ],
    "object_properties": {
        "<cup>": ["GRABBABLE"],
        "<lab_table>":[],
        "<office_table>":[]
  }
}

"""
- A key of "objects" denotes the list of objects or locations.
- A key of "object_properties" denotes properties of the objects in the environment. Properties are nesessary to select appropriate actions.
Object has the following properties:
- GRABBABLE: If an object has this attribute, it can be potentially grabbed by the robot. Thus, this attribute is static.
- BEING_GRABBED: If an object has this attribute, it is being held by the robot. Thus, this attribute is dynamic.
