Start working. Resume from the environment below.
"""
{"environment":[ENVIRONMENT]}
"""
The instruction is as follows:
"""
{"instruction": [INSTRUCTION]}
"""
The dictionary that you return must be formatted as a Python dictionary. Follow these rules:
1. Make sure that each element of the ["step_instructions"] explains corresponding element of the ["task_sequence"]. 
2. DO NOT USE undefined verbs. USE ONLY verbs in "ROBOT ACTION LIST".
3. The arguments of the ROBOT ACTIONs must be selected from the objects in the environment.
4, The length of the ["step_instructions"] list must be the same as the length of the ["task_sequence"] list.
5. You must output a valid Python dictionary. Never leave ',' at the end of the list.
6. Keep track of all items listed in the "environment" field. Please ensure that you fill out both the "objects" and "object_states" sections for all listed items. 
7. All keys of the dictionary must be double-quoted.
8. Insert "```python" at the beginning and the insert "```" at end of the dictionary to separate it from the rest of your response. That is, your response must be formatted as follows:
```python
{... your response, which must be a valid Python dictionary...}
```
9. Ensure that Preconditions and Postconditions are satisfied for each step. 
10. Make sure that nothing is being grabbed in the hands in the end of the operation.
"""
Adhere to the output format I defined above. Note that the input text is not case sensitive. Follow the nine rules. Think step by step.
