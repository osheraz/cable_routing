# Installation

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** Currently, we use ROS only for the camera module. This dependency can be easily replaced. However, if you plan to perform real-time control, following all installation steps is necessary.

(From Justin's repo)

Full install tested on Ubuntu 22.04 ROS Noetic in mamba-forge environment.
